# Control of pole position with moving cart

  The goal of this project is to design a controller to hold the pole position vertical with below constraints
  - Start from x=0, theta=pi; End at x=20
  - Theta not to deviate more than +/-15 from pi all throughout
  
  Pole Placement Technique is used to acheive the desired response.
